# Lung-Cancer-Detection-
This project aims to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on patient medical data in order to support early detection and medical decision-making. The system analyzes key health indicators such as age, smoking habits, coughing symptoms, and other medical attributes, and classifies patients into high-risk or low-risk categories.
